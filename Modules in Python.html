        <h1>Modules in Python Programming Language</h1>
        <p>We all know<b>Python Programming Language</b>for those who don't know what is Python Programming Language.<br> 
        Python is a popular programming language. <b>It was created by  Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</b> <br>
        It is used for: <b> Web development (server-side), Software development, Mathematics, System scripting.</b> <br>
        Python is a high-performance general-purpose programming language. You can use Python for front-end development, as well as for back-end development. It is incredibly versatile, easy to use, and offers several benefits that make it suitable for front-end web development. Python is a Python programming language just not a great, powerful, intuitive programming language for web and API development but it also shines for data science, machine learning, systems automation, and more. <br>
        In recent years, Python has emerged as a highly popular language in web application development, infrastructure management, and data analysis. Now, it is not a back-room utility language, but it plays a big role in Custom Web Application Development and systems management, data analytics, and machine intelligence.

            <ul> <b>Theano :</b> Optimizing compiler for evaluating mathematical expressions on CPUs and GPUs. Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. It is built on top of NumPy. Theano features:
            <ul>1. Tight integration with NumPy: a similar interface to NumPy’s. numpy.ndarrays are also used internally in Theano-compiled functions.</ul>
            <ul>2. Transparent use of a GPU: perform data-intensive computations up to 140x faster than on a CPU (support for float32 only).</ul>
            <ul>3. Efficient symbolic differentiation: Theano can compute derivatives for functions of one or many inputs.</ul>
            <ul>4. Speed and stability optimizations: avoid nasty bugs when computing expressions such as log(1 + exp(x)) for large values of x.</ul>
            <ul>5. Dynamic C code generation: evaluate expressions faster.</ul>
            <ul>6. Extensive unit-testing and self-verification: includes tools for detecting and diagnosing bugs and/or potential problems.</ul>

            <ul> <b>Open CV :</b>OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i.e whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV. <br> To install this module :<strong>"pip install opencv-python”.</strong> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/" target="blank">Click here to know more</a></ul>

            <ul> <b>Random :</b>Python defines a set of functions that are used to generate or manipulate random numbers through the random module. <br> To install this module :<strong>"pip install random2.</strong> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/random2/" target="blank">Click here to know more</a> </ul>
            
            <ul> <b>Reverse Geocoder :</b>Reverse Geocoder takes a latitude / longitude coordinate and returns the nearest town/city. This library improves on an existing library called reverse_geocode developed by Richard Penman in the following ways: 1. Besides city and country, this library also returns the administrative 1 & 2 regions, latitude and longitude 2. The performance is much faster since a parallelized K-D tree is implemented. <br> To install this module: <strong>"pip install reverse-geocoder.</strong> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/reverse_geocoder/" target="blank">Click here to know more</a></ul>
            
            <ul> <b>RawSocketPy :</b>This library allows you to implement a custom layer 2 communication using raw sockets in Python 2 and Python 3, synchronous and asynchronous, with and without callbacks. Raw socket is a layer 2 python library for communication using the MAC addresses only. This allows you to create a custom-made Ethernet/WiFi communication system which is not using IP nor TCP/UDP or to debug custom frames such as SERCOS III, Profibus, ARP, PTP, ... <br> To install this module :<strong>“pip install rawsocketpy“.</strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/rawsocketpy/" target="blank">Click here to know more </a> </ul>
